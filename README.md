# Kneser-Ney-smoothing
This project I created for Introduction to natural language processing course at my faculty in winter semester of 2019/2020 using Jupyter Notebook and Python. Kneserâ€“Ney smoothing
is one of the most commonly used and best-performed smoothing methods in language modeling. For the corpus, I chose The Transfiguration by Franz Kafka.
